Dear Hiring Manager,

I am thrilled to apply for the Principal Python Developer position at Michael Page, where I can leverage my technical expertise and passion for innovative project development to drive success. With a strong foundation in computer science and engineering, I am confident that my skills align with the company's requirements.

As a technology enthusiast with a proven track record of delivering high-quality projects, I am excited to bring my expertise in Python development, Vue.js, and RESTful API design to your team. My experience in event coordination, communication, and team leadership, as demonstrated in my current roles as Head of Public Relations at Google Developer Student Club and Senior Correspondent of Photography at Spark, has honed my ability to collaborate with cross-functional teams and lead projects from concept to delivery.

I am particularly drawn to this role because of the opportunity to work on cutting-edge software technologies with a clear product focus. My proficiency in Python, JS, and experience with technologies such as Solana, Web3.js, and Zod, make me an ideal candidate for this position. Additionally, my expertise in Git/GitHub, RESTful API development, and API testing using Postman will enable me to contribute to the development team's workflow.

I am excited about the prospect of working with your agile Indo-German team and contributing to the company's growth. I am confident that my strong problem-solving skills, ability to work individually and in an international team, and familiarity with version control systems like Git and application lifecycle systems make me a strong fit for this role.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss my application and how my skills and experience align with the company's requirements. Please do not hesitate to contact me at [ok.anuj30@gmail.com](mailto:ok.anuj30@gmail.com) or 9301783525 to arrange an interview.
